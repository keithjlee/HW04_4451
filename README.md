# 1.575J/4.450J/4.451 Homework 04 // Design Space Sampling and Visualization

This assignment asks you to experiment with sampling, exploration, and visualization of design spaces of structures.  You might find the paper Brown and Mueller 2018 (available on Canvas) helpful for a high-level exposition on the motivation and strategy for sampling and dimensionality reductions.

This repository provides a framework for those looking to approach this assignment in Julia.

If you haven't used Julia before and/or have not installed in on your computer, refer to the instructions from [HW02](https://github.com/keithjlee/HW02_4451).
